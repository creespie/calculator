//pseudocode:
// create an array storing the current number and the old number as strings
//need a function related to all numbers on the calculator to add them on the current number
//a function related to operators to shift the current number to the older number and save the operator selected
//a function for the equal to complete the operation with the operator selected, return the result as the new number and delete the old number
//things to care about: the dot can be present once in every number, 
//using an operator while having one selected should execute the operation and store the result as the old number
